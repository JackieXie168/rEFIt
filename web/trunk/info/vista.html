<h1>Windows Vista and EFI</h1>

<p>
Every now and then the question comes up why rEFIt doesn’t support
booting Windows Vista through EFI.
The short story is that neither Vista nor the Intel Mac firmware
are up to it right now.
Read on for the long story.
</p>

<h2>Microsoft’s Official Position</h2>

<p>
The official word from Microsoft
(in their
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/firmware/efibrief.mspx">EFI and Windows Vista</a>
briefing)
is that the final release of Windows Vista will not support EFI at all.
EFI booting support will be added in a future service pack for Windows Vista,
but will be limited to UEFI 2.0 on 64-bit platforms.
</p>
<p>
All IA64 (a.k.a. Itanium) versions of Windows support EFI as that is the
standard firmware on that platform.
But Apple doesn’t use IA64 CPUs and very likely never will,
so that’s a moot point.
</p>

<h2>Microsoft’s Reality</h2>

<p>
An analysis of the publicly released Windows Vista RC1 DVD images
yields the following results:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The x86 (32-bit) version has no EFI binaries and no special El Torito
boot entry.</li>
<li>The x64 (64-bit) version has two EFI binaries on the ISO/UDF file system,
but no special El Torito boot entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since no current EFI firmware is capable of reading ISO9660 or UDF file systems,
this means that even the x64 disk is not directly bootable on any EFI firmware.
</p>

<h2>Apple’s Reality</h2>

<p>
The current firmware on Intel Macs is based on EFI 1.10,
and runs in 32-bit mode even on the 64-bit-capable Core 2 based machines
(Mac Pro, late-2006 iMac).
</p>
<p>
This means the current Mac firmware is not capable of running the
EFI binaries on the Windows Vista x64 disk,
because those are compiled for a 64-bit EFI environment.
(You just get an “Unsupported” error from EFI if you try anyway.)
It will require a major firmware upgrade from Apple for this to change.
And even then only the recent 64-bit Mac models would be able
to boot Vista through EFI.
</p>
<p>
On a side note, the current state of El Torito support in Apple’s firmware
is still in doubt.
There is a possibility that it no longer detects file systems in secondary
El Torito entries at all,
but the details remain to be tested.
</p>

<h2>The State of rEFIt</h2>

<p>
Current versions of rEFIt are already coded to recognize the file names
of the EFI boot loaders on the Windows Vista DVDs,
and show an appropriate logo for them.
However, the contents of the DVD are not accessible from within the EFI
environment, so all that will show up is the BIOS-based boot code in the
first El Torito entry.
