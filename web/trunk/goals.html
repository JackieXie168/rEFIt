<h1>Goals and Ideas</h1>

<p>
The rEFIt project has a wider scope than just the boot menu.
Some areas that could use attention are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The rEFIt boot menu itself: additional features, robustness,
configurability.</li>
<li>EFI tools: disk partitioning, diagnostics.</li>
<li>EFI file system drivers for various file systems.</li>
<li>UI library: evolve the current menu functions into a small UI library,
or port one of the framebuffer-based GUI libraries to the EFI environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of these points are detailed in the following sections.
If you have additional ideas, feel free to post them to the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=161917&atid=821767">feature request tracker</a>.
Anyone who wants to actually implement one of the ideas is invited to
join the project as a developer.
</p>


<h2>Disk partitioning</h2>

<p>
Boot Camp requires a hybrid GPT/MBR partition table to work properly.
A first step would be a tool that synchronizes the MBR table with the
GPT table, so that GPT-aware tools like Apple's Disk Utility or
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html">GNU Parted</a>
can be used for the actual partitioning.
</p>


<h2>File system drivers</h2>

<p>
EFI supports the FAT file system family out of the box, and
Apple also includes a driver for HFS+. Additional drivers would be
useful, especially for ext2/ext3 and ISO9660.
The code in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GNU grub</a>
could serve as a starting point.
</p>
<p>
To load the drivers, rEFIt would be extended to load all
.efi files in the <tt>\efi\refit\drivers</tt> directory automatically.
