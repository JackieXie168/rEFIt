<h1>Goals and Ideas</h1>

<p>
The rEFIt project has a wider scope than just the boot menu.
Some areas that could use attention are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The rEFIt boot menu itself: additional features, robustness,
configurability.</li>
<li>Mac OS X integration: installation, Startup Disk work-alike.</li>
<li>EFI tools: disk partitioning, diagnostics.</li>
<li>EFI file system drivers for various file systems.</li>
<li>UI library: evolve the current menu functions into a small UI library,
or port one of the framebuffer-based GUI libraries to the EFI environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of these points are detailed in the following sections.
If you have additional ideas, feel free to post them to the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=161917&amp;atid=821767">feature request tracker</a>.
Anyone who wants to actually implement one of the ideas is invited to
join the project as a developer.
</p>


<h2>Boot Menu</h2>

<p>
Some ideas for the boot menu and its UI infrastructure:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Full configurability for OS entries. Configurable default entry.</li>
<li>Remember the last chosen entry (in NVRAM), make it the default entry
on the next boot.</li>
<li>Configurable screen background color, selection highlight color
(submenus), text color.</li>
<li>Allow the CD to be ejected from within the boot menu.</li>
<li>Network support.</li>
</ul>


<h2>UI Infrastructure</h2>

<p>
The graphical functions of the boot menu have already been split into
a separate module. Some plans here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve text rendering: Loadable fonts, antialiased default font</li>
<li>Support loading PNG and JPEG image files in addition to BMP.</li>
<li>Mouse support.</li>
<li>Support for the Apple IR Remote as in the built-in chooser.
(This may require talking directly to the USB HID driver.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mac OS X Integration</h2>

<p>
To improve user friendliness, there is a need to provide better
integration with Mac OS X. Some ideas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a Startup Item to solve the Mac OS X Update and the Safe Sleep
issues.</li>
<li>Make an OS X Installer package (.pkg) that takes care of installation
and <tt>bless</tt>ing.</li>
<li>Provide an application to automate installation and as a replacement
for the Startup Disk preference pane.</li>
<li>Provide a flexible partitioning tool as a replacement for
the limited Boot Camp Assistant.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Disk Partitioning</h2>

<p>
Boot Camp requires a hybrid GPT/MBR partition table to work properly.
rEFIt includes a tool to update the MBR table after editing the GPT table,
but it would be much better to have partitioning tools that support
the hybrid format directly.
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html">GNU Parted</a>
looks promising &mdash; it already supports GPT, and has file system
resizing code for most common file systems. Some tasks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the <tt>gptsync</tt> tool: file system detection for
GPT Basic Data partitions, robustness.</li>
<li>Improve GNU parted to work properly on Intel Macs:
HFS+ little-endian issues, HFS+ GPT partition type,
hybrid GPT/MBR format.</li>
<li>Port GNU parted to Mac OS X (Terminal and/or Cocoa GUI).</li>
<li>Port GNU parted to the EFI environment. (This is currently on hold
in favour of a Linux rescue system.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>File system drivers</h2>

<p>
EFI supports the FAT file system family out of the box, and
Apple also includes a driver for HFS+. Additional drivers would be
useful, especially for ext2/ext3 and ISO9660.
The code in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GNU grub</a>
could serve as a starting point.
</p>
<p>
To load the drivers, rEFIt would be extended to load all
.efi files in the <tt>\efi\refit\drivers</tt> directory automatically.
