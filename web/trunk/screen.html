<h1>Screenshot</h1>

<p>
Here is a screenshot of the graphical boot menu,
taken using a 0.7 development snapshot.
A special screenshot function had to be added to rEFIt itself to take
this picture &ndash; the EFI environment does not come with a screenshot
utility.
</p>
<p>
The picture was cropped to a useful size; in reality the whole screen
is used at native resolution (e.g. 1440 x 900) with the menu
displayed at the center.
Also note that the OS icons are not fixed. rEFIt automatically detects
which operating systems are installed on the internal disk as well
as CDs and external media, and displays an icon for each one.
