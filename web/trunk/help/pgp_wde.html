<h1>PGP Whole Disk Encryption</h1>

<p>
If you are using
<a href="http://www.pgp.com/products/wholediskencryption/index.html">PGP Whole Disk Encryption</a>
with Mac OS X, the usual install methods won't work,
because they install rEFIt on the encrypted partition.
</p>
<p>
Reportedly, PGP Whole Disk Encryption uses an additional hidden HFS+ partition
for bootstrapping, and manually installing rEFIt there works.
Obviously, you won't have access to the encrypted partition if you use rEFIt
to boot another operating system.
