<h1>Booting from RAID</h1>

<p>
Booting Mac OS X from a RAID volume through rEFIt reportedly does not work.
</p>
<p>
The author currently lacks a test system that would be RAID-capable,
as well as further information how booting from a RAID volume on an Intel Mac
works.
If you can help with either one, please get in touch.
