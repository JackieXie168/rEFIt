<h1>Reboot after Install</h1>

<p>
On Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and 10.6 (Snow Leopard) the rEFIt boot menu
does not appear on the first reboot after using the package installer.
Just reboot the Mac again. (You donâ€™t need to log in first.)
</p>
<p>
If the rEFIt menu does not appear on the second reboot,
other software on your Mac may be interfering with the Mac OS X shutdown
sequence.
That can cause the <tt>rEFItBlesser</tt> startup item to not be run, and the
Mac will boot straight into Mac OS X on the next boot.
Further details are still under investigation.
