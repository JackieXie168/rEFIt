<h1>Multiple Internal Disks</h1>

<p>
Booting Windows or Linux from the second (third, fourth, ...) internal hard
disk through rEFIt currently does not work as expected.
</p>
<p>
According to Appleâ€™s
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3777">Boot Camp FAQ</a>
any internal disk works,
so you may be able to boot from the second disk using the built-in boot menu.
Hold down the Option key during startup to activate that boot menu.
</p>
<p>
It may be possible to properly support booting from the second disk in rEFIt,
but the author currently lacks a suitable test system.
If you can help investigate this and are willing to test patched rEFIt builds,
please get in touch.
