<h1>Changing the Icons</h1>

<p>
All icons displayed in the main menu are loaded from .icns files in the “efi/refit/icons” directory. Changing those affects the default icons. That is, when you replace “os_mac.icns”, it will be used for Mac OS X on the internal disk as well as the Mac OS X install DVD. In any case, make sure that the icon you use has an icon image for the required resolution — 128x128 for os_*, 48x48 for func_* and tool_*, 32x32 for vol_*.
</p>
<p>
To customize the icon only for a specific boot entry (e.g. Mac OS X on the internal disk), put the .icns file into the same directory as the EFI loader and give it the same name, e.g. “efi/linux/elilo.icns” if you use “elilo.efi”.
