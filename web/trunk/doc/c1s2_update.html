<h1>Upgrading rEFIt</h1>

<h2>Using the Installer Package</h2>
<p>
If you have a previous version of rEFIt installed in the standard location
on your Mac OS X volume, you can use the installer package to upgrade to
version 0.8. Just follow the steps for
<a href="c1s1_install.html">installation</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that the installer package may overwrite your customized
configuration file or icons.
</p>

<h2>Manual Upgrade</h2>
<p>
To manually upgrade an installation of rEFIt, just replace it with the
files from the current distribution.
Copy everything in the “efi” folder, only skipping the files you have
customized and want to keep.
Afterwards, run “enable.sh” again to make sure rEFIt is properly blessed.
