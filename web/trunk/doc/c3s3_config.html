<h1>The refit.conf Configuration File</h1>

<p>
Starting with version 0.6, rEFIt has a configuration file. It must be in the same folder as “refit.efi” and must be named “refit.conf”. An example file with comments for each option is provided with the binary distribution.
</p>
<p>
The configuration file currently allows you to change the timeout, force text-only mode, hide volume badge icons, and re-order legacy boot entries.
