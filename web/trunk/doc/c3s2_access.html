<h1>Restricting Access</h1>

<!--
<h2>Disabling Tools</h2>
<p>
The “disable” command in the configuration file allows you to
remove some or all of the entries from the lower row of the boot menu.
</p>
-->

<h2>Removing the Shell and Tools</h2>
<p>
You may want to remove the EFI shell from the menu, for example in a student lab setting. Simply remove the “efi/tools” folder. (Also remove the “efi/refit/apps” folder if you still have it from an earlier version of rEFIt.) When the “Shell.efi” file is not found, the corresponding menu choice disappears automatically.
