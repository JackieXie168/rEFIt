<h1>Bluetooth Keyboard Problems</h1>

<p>
Problem: An Apple Wireless Keyboard or another Bluetooth keyboard
works in Mac OS X, but not in rEFIt, LILO, Windows, Linux, whatever.
</p>

<p>
Solution: As mentioned in the
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303572">Boot Camp
Requirements</a>, Apple does not support the use of Bluetooth keyboards
and mice with Boot Camp.
They will actually to some degree, but they will not work <b>realiably</b>.
There is nothing rEFIt could do about this.
If you have problems with your wireless keyboard,
use a USB or built-in keyboard instead.
