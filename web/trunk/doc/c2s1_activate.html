<h1>Getting into the rEFIt menu</h1>

<p>
If you have installed rEFIt on your Mac OS X volume, it will be loaded automatically when the Mac starts up.
</p>
<p>
With rEFIt installed on a separate volume (internal or external) or on a CD, hold down the “Option” key while the Mac starts up. That activates the built-in boot menu, where you’ll see an icon labeled “rEFIt”. Choose it with the arrow keys and hit Return, and the rEFIt menu will be loaded.
</p>
<p>
You can configure your Mac to automatically start the rEFIt menu even when it is installed on a separate volume. Just use “enable-always.sh” instead of “enable.sh”.
