<h1>General Keyboard Problems</h1>

<p>
Problem: The keyboard doesn’t work at the LILO prompt or after booting
from a Windows installation disk.
</p>

<p>
Solution: This is a bug in Apple’s firmware.
There is nothing rEFIt could do about this.
</p>
<p>
So far the only reports are from MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo models,
but other Core 2 Duo models may be affected as well.
Usually the keyboard works on some boots, but not every time.
So the workaround is to reboot and try again.
