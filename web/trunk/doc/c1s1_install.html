<h1>Installing rEFIt</h1>

<h2>Burning a CD</h2>
<p>
If you just want to try out rEFIt without affecting your computer,
you can burn rEFIt to a CD-R (or CD-RW) and boot from that.
The distributed .dmg and .cdr disk images are ready to burn.
</p>


<h2>Installing on the Mac OS X volume</h2>
<p>
The most common way to install and use rEFIt is on the Mac OS X installation
volume on the internal hard disk.
This requires no additional volumes or disks.
</p>
<p>
The steps to install rEFIt this way are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and mount the
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/refit/rEFIt-0.7.dmg?download">rEFIt-0.7.dmg</a>
disk image.</li>
<li>Copy the “efi” folder from the disk image to the root level of
your Mac OS X volume.</li>
<li>Open Terminal and enter the following commands:
<pre>cd /efi/refit
./enable.sh</pre>
When prompted, enter the password for your user account.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note: If you get a message saying “No such file or directory” in
the last step, then you didn't put the “efi” folder in the right
place in step 2.
</p>
<p>
If you downloaded the .cdr image or the .tar.gz archive, you can use
that instead. The contents are the same for all three formats.
The .cdr image can be mounted like a disk image, and the
.tar.gz archive can be extracted by double-clicking it.
</p>


<h2>Installing on a separate volume or external disk</h2>
<p>
If you're uncomfortable with having rEFIt on your Mac OS X volume,
you can install it on any other volume, as long as it is formatted
in the HFS+ (“Mac OS Extended”) format. For example, you can install
rEFIt on a USB flash drive.
</p>
<p>
The installation procedure is basically the same as explained above
&mdash; copy the “efi” folder to the root of the volume, and
run “enable.sh” inside the “efi/refit” directory.
The path in Terminal will be different, for example
“/Volumes/MyStick/efi/refit” if the volume is named “MyStick”.
</p>
<p>
If you want, you can use the provided “rEFIt.icns” icon as a volume icon.
</p>


<h2>Installing on the EFI System Partition</h2>
<p>
It is also possible to install rEFIt on the hidden “EFI System Partition”
on your internal disk. This is recommended for advanced users only, and
will not be detailed here. You will need to use <tt>bless</tt> with the
<tt>--mount</tt> and <tt>--file</tt> options. Consult the man page for
<tt>bless</tt> for more information.
