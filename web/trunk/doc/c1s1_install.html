<h1>Installing rEFIt</h1>

<h2>Burning a CD</h2>
<p>
If you just want to try out rEFIt without affecting your computer,
you can burn rEFIt to a CD-R (or CD-RW) and boot from that.
The distributed .dmg and .cdr disk images are ready to burn.
</p>

<h2>Installing on a disk volume</h2>
<p>
When you’re ready to use rEFIt for dual-booting (or even triple-booting),
you can install it on a hard disk or USB flash drive.
It is recommended to install it on a separate volume,
but you can also choose to install rEFIt on your Mac OS X volume.
</p>
<p>
rEFIt should be installed on a HFS+ partition.
While it is possible to install rEFIt on a FAT volume like the hidden
EFI System Partition and persuade the firmware to boot it,
that procedure is quite complex.
In any case, the kind of partition table doesn’t matter.
</p>
<p>
Copy the “efi” folder from the distribution to the root level of the destination volume.
Do not put it inside another folder, or some functions won’t work.
</p>
<p>
Open a Terminal window and change to the “refit” folder inside the “efi” folder,
e.g. “cd /efi/refit”. Run “./enable.sh” to make the partition bootable.
You must do this under Mac OS X on an Intel-based Macintosh,
and you will need your administrator password.
</p>
<p>
If you are installing rEFIt to a separate volume, you can use the “rEFIt.icns” icon as a volume icon.
