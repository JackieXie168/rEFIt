<h1>Linux partition shows as FAT32</h1>

<p>
Problem: I used rEFIt and its “Partitioning Tool” to install Linux,
but now the Linux partition is marked as FAT32 in the MBR partition table.
</p>

<p>
Solution: Re-run the “Partitioning Tool” in the rEFIt menu.
</p>
<p>
This can happen when you run the “Partitioning Tool” before you actually
install Linux on the Linux partition.
In the GPT table, the same partition type is used for Windows FAT,
Windows NTFS, and all kinds of Linux file systems.
The rEFIt Partitioning Tool tries to detect which file system is actually
present in the partition so that it can assign the proper MBR partition type.
However, if there is no file system present in the partiton, it falls back
to FAT32.
</p>
<p>
Of course you can also fix this manually using Linux fdisk.
